# Period Cycle Tracker

A modern, full-stack application to help users track and predict their menstrual cycles, built with React, Spring Boot, and Clerk for authentication.

## Overview

This application provides a user-friendly interface for logging period dates, symptoms, and moods. It offers predictions for future cycles and fertility windows. The frontend is built as a responsive single-page application, communicating with a robust Spring Boot backend via a REST API. All user data is kept private and secure behind a robust JWT-based authentication system powered by Clerk.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Frontend)

These instructions will get the frontend development server running on your local machine. It currently uses a mock API server (MSW) for data.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or newer recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)
- A Clerk.dev account to get your API keys.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/bcdipesh/period-cycle-tracker.git
cd period-cycle-tracker/client
```

#### 2. Install dependencies:

```Bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by copying the example file:

```Bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and add your Vite Clerk Publishable Key and Clerk Secret Key. You can find this on the API Keys page of your Clerk Dashboard.

```
# Clerk Secret Keys

VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test\***\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test\***\*\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***
```

#### 4. Run the development server:

```Bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with MSW enabled.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the dist folder.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code using ESLint to find and fix problems.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally to preview it.
